# Compiler-for-C--
##function
design a compiler for a C-like language,including lexical,grammar and semantic analysis,intermediate code generation and optimization and MIPS32 code generation  
##additional application  
flex bison  
##composition  
Code : includeing the codes for the compiler  
grammar.pdf: the introduction for the grammar  
Test : test program for the compiler(you can write your own test program to test the codes)
parser : the executable program for the compiler  
Readme.md : the document to help understand the project  
##how to run the procedure  
In the Code catalog,you can use the makefile to compiler the all codes,it will generate the executable program named parser
